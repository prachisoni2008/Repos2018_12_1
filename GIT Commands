general rules for writing commit message

https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

remove a file from git project

stop tracking the file first
git rm filename
in dir wont see it
( now file has been deleted locally) once commited it will be gone from project


keep the file but not track 
git rm --cached filename
on dir it will be there

to rename a file 
git mv README.md README

old  name new name
